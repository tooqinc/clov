/* THANKS */
							
Name: Matt Kantor - Matt was contracted to build Clov a few years ago and did a great job. 

I don't much time or inclination to carry forward with it at this point and so I release it as an open source project under the MIT licence for the Concrete5 community to carry on with it or ignore it.

Thanks to everyone at Concrete5 and in the C5 community.
