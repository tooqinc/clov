Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Customer is granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the Software Application for a single website and a single staging or development version.  Customer may not offer the System for resale without expressed permission from Tooq Inc.  

2.  Augmenting Code. Customer may modify, supplement, adapt, translate or create derivative works based upon the System.

3.  Ownership.  The System is licensed, not sold.  Customer acknowledges that the System (including any changes Customer may request or suggest) is the property of Tooq Inc or its licensors.

The Customer agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service directly or indirectly to any country for which the U.S. government or any agencies thereof requires an export license or other government approval without first obtaining such license or approval.

7.  Miscellaneous.  
     -  Entire Agreement.  This document constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous negotiations and agreements, whether written or oral.  No modification or amendment to this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights, will be effective unless assented to in writing by both parties, and the waiver of any breach or default will not constitute a waiver of any other right or any other breach or default.  This Agreement may be amended only by a writing signed by both parties.
     -  Assignment. Customer may not assign any portion of this Agreement except with the prior written consent of Tooq Inc, and any attempt to assign (by operation of law or otherwise) this Agreement or any part thereof without consent shall be null and void.  However, Tooq Inc shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to an assignment.
     -  Forum Selection and Choice of Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Oregon, without regard to its choice of law rules.  By entering into this Agreement Customer agrees to be subject to personal jurisdiction in Oregon courts.  Any litigation arising from or related to this Agreement shall be brought only in the federal or state courts in Multnomah County, Oregon. 
     -  Attorneys Fees; Costs.  In addition to any other relief, the prevailing party in any dispute arising under this Agreement will be entitled to all reasonable legal fees and costs.
     -  Performance. A party is not liable under this Agreement for non-performance, if the non-performance is caused by events or conditions beyond that party's control, and provided the party makes reasonable efforts to perform under the circumstances.  The obligations and rights of the party so excused shall be extended on a day-to-day basis for the period of time equal to that of the underlying cause of the delay. This provision does not relieve Customer of its obligation to make any payments then owing.
     -  Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining provisions shall not be affected. 
     -  Headings. Section headings are for convenience only and shall have no substantive meaning. 
     -  Survival.  Provisions of this Agreement relating to warranties, intellectual property rights, limitation and exclusion of liability, indemnification, and payment obligations will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.
